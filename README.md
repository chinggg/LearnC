# Welcome!   
If you are a freshman in SHU and have problem with the compulsory course of C programming, you can have a look here.  
I will upload resources which may be helpful to learn C programming on your own.

## Tips
- Develop self-study skills
- Reading classical books (I recommend *C Primer Plus* for new beginners)
- Practice by coding rather than watching
- Understand the fundamental principles rather than learning by rote 

## To International Students  
Since some of you cannot go back to sit in the classroom, we want to help you learn the course better by providing extra coaching. 
We will answer your questions via video conference on a weekly basis. Since your regions may have different time zones, we decided to start the video conference at 8:00 p.m.(China Standard Time).  
**Here we must remind you that if you decide to participate in our coaching program, you may not quit it for no reason. We will check on attendance to ensure everyone takes full advantage of the coaching.**

If you have any other ideas, please let me know by opening an issue or just speaking in the WeChat Group.
