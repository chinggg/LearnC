# Welcome!   
If you are a freshman in SHU and have problem with the compulsory course of C programming, you can have a look here.  
I will upload resources which may be helpful to learn C programming on your own.

## Tips
- Develop self-study skills
- Reading classical books (I recommend *C Primer Plus* for new beginners)
- Practice by coding rather than watching
- Understand the fundamental principles rather than learning by rote  
- Take advantage of English resources like [cppreference.com](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language), which is more reliable than some tertiary sources
- Make full use of Google and websites like [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and [Tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/index.htm)
- Be serious about concepts but not stuck in them

## Software
Some of you may use Visual Studio, it is one of the best IDEs in the world. But I recommend [Dev-C++](https://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/) or [Code::Blocks](https://www.fosshub.com/Code-Blocks.html?dwl=codeblocks-20.03mingw-setup.exe) because they are more lightweight and can be used in the final exam.

If you are have access to the campus network of SHU, you can download resources provided by teachers [here](https://class.cc.shu.edu.cn/utf8-sites-class-dir/00864088/).


## To International Students  
Since some of you cannot go back to sit in the classroom, we want to help you learn the course better by providing extra coaching. 
We will answer your questions via video conference on a weekly basis. Since your regions may have different time zones, we decide to start the video conference at 8:00 p.m.(China Standard Time) so that the most of you could attend the meeting at a right time.  
**Here we must remind you that if you decide to participate in our coaching program, you may not quit it for no reason. We will check on attendance to ensure everyone takes full advantage of the coaching.**

If you have any other ideas, please let me know by opening an issue or just speaking in the WeChat Group.
